It is widely agreed upon that water is the most valuable resource, yet the majority of individuals are uninformed and powerless to improve the quality of local water bodies.

Introducing AquaGuard: Revolutionizing Water Quality Monitoring for a Sustainable Future

Our mission is simple yet profound: to provide comprehensive water quality data to people worldwide, empowering them to protect the water they rely on for life and sustenance. Inspired by the once-famous but now polluted Charles River, we are determined to prevent others from witnessing their local water supplies degrade without the means to intervene.

AquaGuard combines cutting-edge satellite technology with local wildlife and human population data to yield insightful implications about water quality. This multifaceted approach not only ensures the accuracy of our assessments but also sheds light on the intricate relationships between ecosystems and human communities.

But we don't stop at data. AquaGuard equips individuals with the resources they need to safeguard their water sources effectively. From EPA registered algaecides to local vegetation planting initiatives and tools to report illegal dumping, we empower communities to take tangible action.

Our vision is simple: water is the quintessential enabler of life, and everyone, regardless of their resources, deserves access to information about the water they rely on. Join us at HackMIT and be a part of the AquaGuard revolution, as we work towards a sustainable future where water quality is a concern of the past. Together, we can ensure that no one is powerless in the face of water pollution, safeguarding the life-giving essence of our planet.
